        Finding significant digits

        Number of Trials: 10
        Class size: 33
        Range of probabilities: 70% - 100%
        Significant digit: Tens place
        Number of significant digits: 1

        Number of Trials: 100
        Class size: 33
        Range of probabilities: 75% - 86%
        Significant digit: Tens and ones place
        Number of significant digits: 2

        Number of Trials: 1000
        Class size: 33
        Range of probabilities: 76.2% - 79.4%
        Significant digit: Tens, ones and tenths place
        Number of significant digits: 3

        Number of Trials: 10000
        Class size: 33
        Range of probabilities: 77.41% - 78.38%
        Significant digit: Tens, ones, tenths and hundredths place
        Number of significant digits: 4

        Number of Trials: 100000
        Class size: 33
        Range of probabilities: 77.337% - 77.556%
        Significant digit: Tens, ones, tenths, hundredths and thousandths place
        Number of significant digits: 5

        Conclusion: As the trials increase, the accuracy of the probabilities and the number of significant digits
        increase.
